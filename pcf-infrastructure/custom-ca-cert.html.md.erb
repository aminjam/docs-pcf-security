This topic provides an overview of using custom certificate authorities (CAs) in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployment.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

To secure traffic in your PCF deployment, you must provide a CA to issue digital certificates. This can be either a Pivotal-generated or custom CA. When you add and activate a new CA, a digital certificate is issued to BOSH Director. BOSH Director then passes the certificate to other components in your PCF deployment. 

Pivotal recommends you supply a CA from a trusted provider when using a production environment. While you can create your own custom CAs if necessary, a trusted CA is more secure because it has been authenticated by the trusted entities permitted to issue them.

<p class ="note"><b>Note:</b> Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) certificates are not supported in PCF.</p>

## <a id='add-custom-ca'></a>Add a Custom CA

You can add a new custom CA as part of the procedure for rotating CAs and other certificate types in PCF. To add and activate a new custom CA in PCF, see [Rotate Root and Leaf Certificates](./api-cert-rotation.html#rotate-ca).
